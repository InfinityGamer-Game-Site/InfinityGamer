##How to compile
run the regular index file in browser
call getCompileScript in the console
copy the output and run it in bash terminal at this file location
The compiled game will be in the JimothyPiggertonCompiled folder
that can be zipped and published.

Assets should be stored in the compiled folder so that both dev and compiled
versions have access to the same files without having to duplicate.
The dev index will specify a path through the compiled folder to get assets.
